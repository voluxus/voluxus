# 🌟 Welcome! Let us meet each other 👋

### 💻 Computer enthusiast since before I could walk. 🐧 Linux-down-to-the-bone explorer, passionate FOSS news consumer.  

I've always wondered how *modern, clickable applications* work — how humanity managed to create mobile, interactive, and intelligent apps running on machines that only *understand binary* 🧠💾.
In middle school, coding in C++ didn’t give me the full answer, yet the small algorithms and benchmarks I created made me feel like I had some real **power ⚡**.
That’s also when I discovered some programming mysteries — like the concept of **asynchronous programming** (🤔 *how do you make a snake game if the C++ `cin` object blocks input?*) — completely unresolvable to me back then.  

Now, through my ongoing **Computer Science studies 🎓**, many details have become clearer:  
— how programs communicate, what the most common **design patterns** are for solving big problems, and how it all interacts with the **OS, GUIs, graphics, and hardware**.  
But there’s still *so much more to learn* — and I’m eager for it! 🚀

## 👷 My engineer profile

- 🎓 **3rd year Applied Computer Science student** at *Politechnika Wrocławska*
- 🧠 Working on an **innovative wearables motion-capture project** for my Bachelor’s thesis:  
  *a sign language VR application* using the [TeslaSuit](https://teslasuit.io) and [SenseGlove](https://www.senseglove.com) hardware 🤲  
- 🧩 **Fundamentals in:**  
  - the traditional CS stack (algorithms, data structures, networking, IoT, scripting, SQL & NoSQL, web apps)  
  - microservices: developing a [hobby project](https://github.com/voluxus/cloud-programming) simulating scalable **event-driven microservices with CQRS** and *Clean Architecture* 🧱  
  - machine learning: built small projects like gender classification using a [sEMG arm band](https://www.oymotion.com/en/product32/149) — *signal processing* with Kalman filters, wrapped in a [PyQt app](https://github.com/Kamotek/emg-analysis-app) 🤖  
  - project cooperation: beyond 2-person coding, participated in a **4-person GitHub workflow** with *feature branches, PRs, merge conflicts,* and weekly syncs 🧑‍💻🤝  
- 🧭 **Specializations:**  
  - **.NET 🧱** – built web apps and REST APIs in C# using ASP-related frameworks; used LINQ for clean and elegant code; currently experimenting with **Vue.js** on the frontend 🌐  
  - **Linux 🐧** – highly comfortable with the Arch Wiki, `/etc/` tinkering, [Atomic distros](https://universal-blue.org), *BTRFS*, encryption, and KVM virtualization.  
    Used Linux as my **daily driver for 4+ years**, even running Windows-only software on it 💪  
    Flashing the OS 10 times in a day for complex setups or experimental flags? Not a problem! 🔥
