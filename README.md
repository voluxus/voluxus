# Welcome! Let us meet each other ðŸ‘‹

### Computer enthusiast since a non-walking child. Linux down-to-the-bone explorer, FOSS news consumer.

I've always wondered, how *modern clickable applications worked* - how did humanity achieve mobile or interactive and intelligent apps, running on a computer only *understanding binary* symbols.
In middle school, coding in C++ did not provide me with the answer, yet the small algorithms and benchmarks I created felt like I had some power.
Also then I discovered some programmistical mysteries, like the asynchronous programming concept (how to do a snake game if the C++ cin object blocks input?) - unresolvable then.

My ongoing computer science studies clarified on many details how the programs communicate, what are the most common design patterns for all the big problems, and some interaction with the OS including graphic libraries, GUIs, and hardware use. But still there is so much more to learn and I am eager for it!

## My engineer profile

- 3rd year *Applied Computer Science* student at Politechnika WrocÅ‚awska
- Ongoing innovative **wearables motion capture** project for the Bachelor's degree: *sign language* VR application using the TeslaSuit and SenseGlove hardware
- Fundamentals in:
  - the traditional CS stack (algorithms, data structures, networking, IoT, scripting, SQL and noSQL, web apps)
  - microservices: developing a hobby project simulating scalable **event-driven microservices with CQRS** and Clean Architecture
  - machine learning: simple neural networks or statistical algorithms; done small project on gender classification based on a sEMG arm band - *signal processing* with Kalman filters
  - project cooperation: throughout the studies done not only 2-people coding, but also participated in more dynamic github workflow in a 4-person project with **feature branches, PRs, merge conflicts** and weeklies
- Specializations
  - **.NET**: used C# to create web apps and REST APIs using the ASP related frameworks; utilized LINQ for code cleanness; now experimenting more with the Vue frontend
  - **Linux**: very comfortable with the archlinux wiki, /etc/ tinkering, Atomic distros, *BTRFS*, encryption, KVM virtualization; have used as the only desktop **daily driver for 4+ years**, even running on it Windows-only software. Flashing the OS 10 times with complex setups or troubleshooting experimental software flags all on the same day? Not an issue!
